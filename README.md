# Translate
This is a translator app developed using Swift for iOS.
The app contains the following functions:
1) The app can choose from the following languages to translate to:
  1)French
  2)Italian
  3)German
This app does this by calling the MyMemory translated API which will translate the inputted text into the destination language.
An extra feature of this app is that it features a speech-to-text function. This uses the Siri API, Speech. By pressing the microphone button, it will begin recording using the audio engine. Pressing it again will stop the recording and display the spoken dialect to type.

This app also shows off different features such as hiding the keyboard, clearing the text field and auto layout. The elements in this app will adjust according to the size of the screen. The standard iPhone 6/6 Plus and iPads are supported.

The logo was created by myself. It is a vector image created in Adobe Illustrator. This logo was created to emphasesize the flat design throughout the app. The launchScreen was also created by me in Adobe Illustrator.
